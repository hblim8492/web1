          target="_blank" title="Description">
   World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly known as the Web,
   is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
   (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.<br>
   The resources of the WWW may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
   English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.<br>
   He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.<br>
   The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and then to the general public in August 1991.<br>
   The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.
